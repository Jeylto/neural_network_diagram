Neural Network Diagram with Hidden Layers using Graphviz
In this repository, I present an example of how to create a diagram of a neural network with hidden layers using the Graphviz library in Python. This diagram is a visual representation of the connections between neurons in an artificial neural network.

Diagram Description
The diagram represents a neural network with input layers, hidden layers, and an output layer. Each circle in the diagram represents a neuron, and the arrows indicate the connections between them. The input layers represent the input data for the neural network, the hidden layers process this data through a series of mathematical operations, and the output layers provide the final results of the neural network.

How to Use the Code
The Python code provided in this repository is a simple implementation to generate the neural network diagram. It uses the Graphviz library to create and render the graph of the neural network based on parameters such as the number of input layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the number of output layers.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Graphviz library installed in your Python environment. You can install the library using pip:


pip install graphviz

Example Usage
See the example provided in the Python code to understand how to configure and create the neural network diagram. You can adjust the parameters as necessary to create different configurations of neural networks.
